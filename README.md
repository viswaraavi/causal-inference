Manufacturer Retailer Price Causal Inference. 
Overview
Identifying the strategy employed by business firms has motivated empirical research towards
studying a firm’s behavior. If there exists a specific pattern that can describe the interactions
between the manufacturers and retailers, the application of causality analysis on their pricing
interaction can clarify their strategic behavior.
The interactions between the manufacturer and retailer can be discussed to follow a vertical-
integrated system or Stackelberg leadership bilateral-monopoly model. In a vertical-integrated
system, the manufacturer and retailer cooperate to maximize the profit of the distribution
channel instead of individual profit. The important character of this model is that both the
manufacturer and retailer affect the sales of the product.
In the Stackelberg leadership modeling, the Stackelberg leader anticipates the response of his
opponents with respect to his strategy while his followers do not know how their behavior affect
the leader’s strategic choice. Thus, the Stackelberg leader enjoys a major share of the profit and
has a stronger pricing power than the follower. To illustrate this, a Retailer Stackelbeg leader can
manipulate the manufacturer’s price and in case of Manufacturer Stackelberg leader, the
manufacturer can manipulate the retailer’s price to maximize his profit.
The goal of this project is to observe whether the system comprising of the manufacturer’s price,
retailer’s price and quantity of soft drinks sold, follows a vertical-integrated system or a
Stackelberg leader model. This project will give insight into studying strategic interaction
between firms using causal discovery methods.
